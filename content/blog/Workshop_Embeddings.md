# Demystify AI's Text Understanding: A Hands-on Journey into Embeddings & Tokenization

Ever wondered how ChatGPT turns your words into meaningful responses? Or how Spotify knows which songs you'll love? The secret lies in embeddings and tokenization - and this workshop will show you exactly how they work.

## Prerequisites

* Basic Python programming knowledge
* Familiarity with simple data structures (lists, dictionaries)
* No advanced math required - we'll build intuition first!

## What You'll Learn

* Turn text into numbers that AI models can understand
* Visualize word embeddings and understand semantic relationships
* Learn how tokenization is done, and a brief primer on positional embeddings
* Understand the math behind tokenisation and embeddings.

## By Workshop's End

You'll gain the ability to:

* Understand how modern AI models process text at a fundamental level
* Get an understanding of different embedding techniques
* Brief taster to next lesson's topic: Transformers
