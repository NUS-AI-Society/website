# AI Agents: From Simple Tools to Autonomous Systems

Ever wondered how AI can automatically execute complex tasks? Or how chatbots can interact with real-world applications? This workshop explores the world of AI agents - systems that can observe, decide, and act autonomously.

## Prerequisites

* Understanding of LLMs and RAG
* Basic Python programming knowledge
* Previous workshops in the series recommended

## What You'll Learn

* Prompting Strategies

* Chain of Thought
* Tree of Thoughts
* Implicit Chain of Thought
