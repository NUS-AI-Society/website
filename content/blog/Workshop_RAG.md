# Retrieval Augmented Generation: Making LLMs Context-Aware

Ever wondered how ChatGPT plugins work? Or how companies use LLMs with their private data? This workshop dives into Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG), the technique powering context-aware AI applications.

## Prerequisites

* Basic understanding of LLMs and transformers
* Familiarity with embeddings and vector databases
* Basic Python programming knowledge
* Previous workshops in the series recommended but not required

## What You'll Learn

* Core RAG Components:

* Document processing and chunking strategies
* Vector stores and efficient retrieval
* Prompt engineering for RAG

* Practical Implementation:

* Building a RAG pipeline from scratch
* Integration with popular vector databases
* Performance optimization
* Evaluation metrics and testing

## By Workshop's End

You'll gain the ability to:

* Build end-to-end RAG systems
* Choose appropriate retrieval strategies
* Optimize RAG performance
* Deploy production-ready RAG applications
